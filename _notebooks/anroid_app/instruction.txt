You work as a Data Analyst for a finance company which is closely eyeing the Android market before it launches its new app into Google Play. You have been asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps so that the team gets a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, their ratings, and other metrics.

This will require you to use your data manipulation and data analysis skills.

Your three questions are as follows:

Read the apps.csv file and clean the Installscolumn to convert it into integer data type. Save your answer as a DataFrame apps. Going forward, you will do all your analysis on the apps DataFrame.

Find the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating. Save your answer as a DataFrame app_category_info. Your should rename the four columns as: Category, Number of apps, Average price, Average rating.

Find the top 10 free FINANCE apps having the highest average sentiment score. Save your answer as a DataFrame top_10_user_feedback. Your answer should have exactly 10 rows and two columns named: App and Sentiment Score, where the average Sentiment Score is sorted from highest to lowest.
