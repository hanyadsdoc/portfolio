To that end, many modern apartment buildings have begun retrofitting their parking garages to include shared charging stations. A charging station is shared if it is accessible by anyone in the building.\n","\n","But with increasing demand comes competition for these ports — nothing is more frustrating than coming home to find no charging stations available! In this project, you will use a dataset to help apartment building managers better understand their tenants’ EV charging habits.\n","\n","The data has been loaded into an Azure Databricks database, containing a schema called `vehicles` and a single table named `charging_sessions` with the following columns:\n","\n","## vehicles.charging_sessions\n","\n","| Column | Definition | Data type |\n","|-|-|-|\n","|`garage_id`| Identifier for the garage/building|`STRING`|\n","|`user_id` | Identifier for the individual user|`STRING`|\n","|`user_type`|Indicating whether the station is `Shared` or `Private`| `STRING` |\n","|`start_plugin`|The date and time the session started |`TIMESTAMP`|\n","|`start_plugin_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session started | `NUMERIC`|\n","|`end_plugout`|The date and time the session ended | `TIMESTAMP` |\n","|`end_plugout_hour`|The hour (in military time) that the session ended | `NUMERIC`|\n","|`duration_hours`| The length of the session, in hours|`NUMERIC`|\n","|`el_kwh`| Amount of electricity used (in Kilowatt hours)|`NUMERIC`|\n","|`month_plugin`| The month that the session started |`STRING`|\n","|`weekdays_plugin`| The day of the week that the session started|`STRING`|\n","\n","Let’s get started!\n","\n","#### Sources\n","- **Data**: [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/residential-ev-chargingfrom-apartment-buildings),\n","- **Image**: Julian Herzog, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","***\n","Write three SQL queries to answer the following questions:\n","\n","Find the number of unique individuals that use each garage’s shared charging stations. The output should contain two columns: garage_id and num_unique_users. Sort your results by the number of unique users from highest to lowest. Save the result as unique_users_per_garage.\n","\n","Find the top 10 most popular charging start times (by weekday and start hour) for sessions that use shared charging stations. Your result should contain three columns: weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, and a column named num_charging_sessions containing the number of plugins on that weekday at that hour. Sort your results from the most to the least number of sessions. Save the result as most_popular_shared_start_times.\n","\n","Find the users whose average charging duration last longer than 10 hours when using shared charging stations. Your result should contain two columns: user_id and avg_charging_duration. Sort your result from highest to lowest average charging duration. Save the result as long_duration_shared_users.\n","\n","Three SQL cells have been created for you in the workbook.
