Use the faang_stocks.csv dataset to complete the following analysis:

What are the expected returns and the annualized Sharpe ratio of an equally-weighted portfolio? Assume the risk-free rate is 0% and store your answers as a float variables called benchmark_exp_return and benchmark_sharpe_ratio.

Find a portfolio that minimizes volatility. Use mean-variance optimization. Store the volatility of the portfolio as a float variable called mv_portfolio_vol. Store the portfolio weights as a pandas Series called mv_portfolio. Use the tickers as index.

Find a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. Use mean-variance optimization and keep the risk-free rate at 0%. Store the Sharpe ratio (annualized) of the portfolio as a float variable called ms_portfolio_sharpe. Store the portfolio weights as a pandas Series called ms_portfolio. Use the tickers as index.
