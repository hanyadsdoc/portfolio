In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n","\n","Knowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n","\n","They have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","***\n","Identify the single feature of the data that is the best predictor of whether a customer will put in a claim (the \"outcome\" column), excluding the \"id\" column.\n","Store as a DataFrame called best_feature_df, containing columns named \"best_feature\" and \"best_accuracy\" with the name of the feature with the highest accuracy, and the respective accuracy score."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8928ffdf-25d6-4ad9-909f-0dd8d10b9a42","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","## The
