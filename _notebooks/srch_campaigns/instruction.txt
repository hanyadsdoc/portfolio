What keywords would help the client sell the listed products through search campaigns?

Save at least 60 unique keywords as a DataFrame called keywords_df and a CSV file called keywords.csv.
Both of these should contain four columns:
Ad Group: containing the product names
Keyword: containing the product and keyword combinations, combined in both directions (word + product, and product + word)
Campaign: with the value SEM_Sofas in every row
Criterion Type: with the value Exact in every row.
