How many of each event did Judge and Stanton have in 2017?

Save your answer as two Pandas Series: judge_events_2017 and stanton_events_2017.
The events should be the index, and the event counts should be in descending order.
Which player hit home runs slightly lower and harder?

Visualize the launch_speed versus launch_angle for each players' home runs with one plot for each player. Save the plots under fig1 and ax1.
Save either "Stanton" or "Judge" to a variable named player_hr.
Compare the pitch velocity, or release_speed, for both players using plots. Which player hit their home runs off of faster pitches (has the highest median)?

Save either "Stanton" or "Judge" to a variable named player_fast.
Construct a 2D histogram for each player that visualizes the home run strike zones, ignoring zones 11, 12, 13, and 14 for simplicity.

Create a new filtered DataFrame for each player called judge_strike_hr and stanton_strike_hr.
Use the custom functions provided to assign coordinates to the data; save these as new columns zone_x and zone_y in the new DataFrames.
