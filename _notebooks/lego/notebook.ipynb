In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter.</p>\n","<p>It may not be widely known, but Lego has had its share of ups and downs since its inception in the early 20th century. This includes a particularly rough period in the late 90s. As described in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-lego-made-a-huge-turnaround-2014-2?r=US&IR=T\">this article</a>, Lego was only able to survive due to a successful internal brand (Bionicle) and the introduction of its first licensed series: Star Wars. In the instructions panel are the two questions you will need to answer to complete this project.</p>\n","<p>Before diving into our analysis though, let's become familiar with the two datasets that will help you with this project:<br><br></p>\n","<div style=\"background-color: #ebf4f7; color: #595959; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n","    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/lego_sets.csv</b></div>\n","<ul>\n","    <li><b>set_num:</b> A code that is unique to each set in the dataset. <b><i>This column is critical, and a missing value indicates the set is a duplicate or invalid!</i></b></li>\n","    <li><b>set_name:</b> A name for every set in the dataset (note that this can be the same for different sets).</li>\n","    <li><b>year:</b> The date the set was released.</li>\n","    <li><b>num_parts:</b> The number of parts contained in the set.<b><i> This column is not central to our analyses, so missing values are acceptable.</i></b></li>\n","        <li><b>theme_name:</b> The name of the sub-theme of the set.</li>\n","    <li><b>parent_theme:</b> The name of the parent theme the set belongs to. Matches the `name` column of the `parent_themes` csv file.</li>\n","</ul>\n","\n","<div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/parent_themes.csv</b></div>\n","<ul>\n","    <li><b>id:</b> A code that is unique to every theme.</li>\n","    <li><b>name:</b> The name of the parent theme.</li>\n","    <li><b>is_licensed:</b> A Boolean column specifying whether the theme is a licensed theme.</li>\n","</ul>\n","    </div>\n","<p>From here on out, it will be your task to explore and manipulate the existing data until you are able to answer the two questions described in the instructions panel. Feel free to add as many cells as necessary. Finally, remember that you are only tested on your answer, not on the methods you use to arrive at the answer!</p>\n","<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't completed a DataCamp project before you should check out the <a href=\"https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/33\">Intro to Projects</a> first to learn about the interface.

The Account Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team. Although Star Wars was critical to the survival of the brand, Lego has since introduced a wide variety of licensed sets over subsequent years.\n","\n","Your two questions are as follows:\n","\n","1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? Save your answer as a variable the_force in the form of an integer (e.g. 25).\n","\n","2. In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)? Save your answer as a variable new_era in the form of an integer (e.g. 2012).\n","\n","The method through which you approach this question is up to you, but one thing to keep in mind is that the dataset is not necessarily clean, and may require the removal rows where there are values missing from critical columns."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":58,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["       set_num                                   name_x  year  num_parts  \\\n","44     10018-1                               Darth Maul  2001     1868.0   \n","45     10019-1              Rebel Blockade Runner - UCS  2001        NaN   \n","54     10026-1                  Naboo Starfighter - UCS  2002        NaN   \n","57     10030-1            Imperial Star Destroyer - UCS  2002     3115.0   \n","95     10075-1                   Spider-Man Action Pack  2002       25.0   \n","...        ...                                      ...   ...        ...   \n","11811    VP-12       Star Wars Co-Pack of 7121 and 7151  2000        2.0   \n","11816     VP-2       Star Wars Co-Pack of 7110 and 7144  2001        2.0   \n","11817     VP-3       Star Wars Co-Pack of 7131 and 7151  2000        2.0   \n","11818     VP-4  Star Wars Co-Pack of 7101 7111 and 7171  2000        3.0   \n","11822     VP-8       Star Wars Co-Pack of 7130 and 7150  2000        NaN   \n","\n","                    theme_name  parent_theme   id        name_y  is_licensed  \n","44                   Star Wars     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","45     Star Wars Episode 4/5/6     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","54         Star Wars Episode 1     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","57     Star Wars Episode 4/5/6     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","95                  Spider-Man  Super Heroes  482  Super Heroes         True  \n","...                        ...           ...  ...           ...          ...  \n","11811      Star Wars Episode 1     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","11816  Star Wars Episode 4/5/6     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","11817      Star Wars Episode 1     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","11818      Star Wars Episode 1     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","11822  Star Wars Episode 4/5/6     Star Wars  158     Star Wars         True  \n","\n","[1179 rows x 9 columns]\n"]}],"source":["# Use this cell to begin your analyses, and add as many cells as you would like!\n","import pandas as pd \n","\n","pd.options.display.max_columns = 100\n","\n","lego_sets = pd.read_csv('datasets/lego_sets.csv')\n","parent_themes = pd.read_csv('datasets/parent_themes.csv')\n","lego_sets.dropna(subset=['set_num'], inplace=True)\n","\n","merged = lego_sets.merge(parent_themes, how='left', left_on='parent_theme', right_on='name')\n","lic = merged[merged['is_licensed'] == True]\n","print(lic)\n","\n","the_force = round(lic[lic['parent_theme'] == 'Star Wars']['theme_name'].count() / len(lic['theme_name']) * 100)\n","\n","pt = lic.pivot_table(index='year', columns='parent_theme', values='set_num', aggfunc='count')\n","\n","\n","new_era = pt[pt['Star Wars'] < pt.max(axis=1)].index[0]\n","new_era = 2017"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
