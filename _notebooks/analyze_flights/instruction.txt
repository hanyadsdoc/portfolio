Which airlines and routes (for example "PDX-SFO") are most affected by flight delays, and what impact does wind have on departure delays?

Load the two CSV files into separate DataFrames. Explore the data and create any new columns that might benefit your analysis.
For routes, calculate the average departure delays and highest number of canceled flights and store this as a DataFrame called routes_delays_cancels, resetting the index after calculating.
For airlines, determine the average departure delays and the highest number of canceled flights and store this as a DataFrame called airlines_delays_cancels, resetting the index after calculating.
Produce two bar graphs to show (1) the top 9 highest number of cancellations by route in a plot called top9_route_cancels_bar and (2) the top 9 highest average departure delays by airline in a plot called top9_airline_delays_bar.
Determine if 10 mile per hour wind gusts or more have a larger average departure delay for both of SEA and PDX, setting wind_response to True if so and False if not.
