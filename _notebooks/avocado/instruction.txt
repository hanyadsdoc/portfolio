Apply your data manipulation and analysis skills to investigate the supply chain of ingredients for making avocado toast in the U.K. Your task is to determine the following information:

The name of the most common country of origin for each of the three key ingredients: avocados, olive oil, and sourdough.
Store the most common country of origin for each ingredient in the following variables: top_avocado_origin, top_olive_oil_origin, and top_sourdough_origin. Ensure that the country names contain only letters (A-Z) and spaces, with no hyphens or other characters.

To focus your analysis, subset each of the DataFrames to include only these relevant columns: 'code', 'lc', 'productnameen', 'quantity', 'servingsize', 'packagingtags', 'brands', 'brandstags', 'categoriestags', 'labelstags', 'countries', 'countriestags', 'origins', 'origins_tags'.

After completing this project, feel free to explore other questions using the food data!
